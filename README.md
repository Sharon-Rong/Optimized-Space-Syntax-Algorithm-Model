# Optimized-Space-Syntax-Algorithm-Model
code cluster of Optimized Space Syntax Algorithm Model in paper "Analyzing Spatiotemporal Features of Suzhou's Old Canal City: An Optimized Composite Space Syntax Model Based on Multifaceted Historical-Modern Data"
1. use space syntax with Python to associate SHP files with Excel attribute tables containing space syntax properties, utilizing breadth-first algorithm to calculate NACO values while maintaining consistent attribute formatting.
2. employ the Location Quotient Calculation file to compute the LQ values.
