# Optimized-Space-Syntax-Algorithm-Model
code cluster of Optimized Space Syntax Algorithm Model in paper 
1. use space syntax with Python to associate SHP files with Excel attribute tables containing space syntax properties, utilizing breadth-first algorithm to calculate NACO values while maintaining consistent attribute formatting.
2. employ the Location Quotient Calculation file to compute the LQ values.
